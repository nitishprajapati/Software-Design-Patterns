Observer Design Pattern: (one-to-many dependency)
-------------------------------------------------

The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, 
called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.

It is mainly used to implement distributed event handling systems, in "event driven" software.


Memory Leak and Weak/Strong References:
---------------------------------------
The observer pattern can cause memory leaks, known as the lapsed listener problem, 
because in basic implementation it requires both explicit registration and explicit deregistration, as in the dispose pattern, 
because the subject holds strong references to the observers, keeping them alive. 
This can be prevented by the subject holding weak references to the observers.
